                        I have an unyielding passion for technology and a deep desire to join a
                        forward-focused company. I want to be part of a team dedicated to making
                        a positive impact through innovative tech development. My journey in the
                        tech world has been all about exploring new horizons and finding ways to
                        harness technology for the greater good. I thrive in tight-knit communities
                        where collaboration is key. Working with a diverse group of talented individuals
                        is something I truly enjoy. I believe the best ideas come from collective brainstorming
                        and bringing different perspectives together. I'm always excited to meet new people and
                        try new things, so feel free to reach out and connect with me!

                            <strong>Soccer:</strong> As captain of the Sarah Lawrence Men's Soccer team for three exhilarating years, I thrived on the thrill of competition and the camaraderie of my teammates. My passion for soccer started young and has always been my go-to stress relief. Along the way, I earned four Defensive Player of the Week awards, the Rookie of the Year award, and a spot on the Skyline Conference honor roll three times. Along the way I also managed to break three program records in goalkeeping. Now, I enjoy giving back through one-on-one youth coaching with some of my former teammates. And yes, I'm a die-hard Barcelona fan â€“ Forca Barca!

                            <strong>Volleyball:</strong> I discovered volleyball on a whim and it quickly became a new passion. Playing for Sarah Lawrence's Division 3 team for two years, I not only had a blast but also broke two program records and earned the Coaches Award and a Skyline Conference honor roll spot. Volleyball taught me the joy of trying new things and excelling in unexpected arenas.

It was all about creating unforgettable experiences and fostering a love for winter sports.

We organized events to celebrate diversity and make everyone feel at home in our athletic department.

                            <strong>Movies and TV:</strong> I'm a huge fan of movies and TV shows, with a special place in my heart for anything Christopher Nolan directs.
