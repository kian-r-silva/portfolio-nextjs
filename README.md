This is my first attempt at a portfolio site. To build this I used NextJS and Vercel to host the page. To help me learn the in's and out's of nextJS and tailwind I used the documentation and @codecommerce on Youtube, by following his tutorials and frameworks and adding my own spins to those. 

In the future, I would love to add more effects to the texts to make the page feel more dynamic and more like an experience rather than an information platform. I would also like to build out my own api for the form submissions instead of utilizing getform.io.
