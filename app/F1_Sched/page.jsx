                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This is my Calculus II conference project, created at Sarah Lawrence College for Ross Parker's class. This semester-long research project allowed me to explore my interests in optimization algorithms while applying key concepts learned throughout the course.

                        Formula One Racing is a unique sport that combines advanced engineering and exceptional driving skills. Each year, teams must design and develop a new car, focusing on innovations in areas like aerodynamics and engine efficiency. Recently, the sport has been transitioning to more eco-friendly hybrid engines. However, despite these advancements, the sport's global travel schedule is inefficient, causing unnecessary carbon emissions and financial strain on teams.

                        To address this, I explored optimizing the Formula One calendar using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, which is inspired by the metallurgical process of heating and cooling materials to eliminate impurities. This algorithm helps find a near-optimal travel route by gradually refining solutions through random exploration and systematic cooling.

                        By applying Simulated Annealing, I was able to reduce the total travel distance by over 94,000 kilometers, making the season more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. This optimization could lead to more efficient transportation methods and reduced expenses for Formula One teams, ultimately enhancing the competition and sustainability of the sport.
